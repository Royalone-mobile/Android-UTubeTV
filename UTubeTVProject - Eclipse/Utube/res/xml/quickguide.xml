        <text>The first thing you'll see is the 'about page' of the default channel.</text>
        <text>Every channel has an about page with an image and a description of the channel.</text>
        <text>Click on the image or the "Watch Now" button. They both takes you to the channel's
            list of playlists.
        </text>
        <text>A playlist is a collection of videos organized by the channel administrator.</text>
        <text>Clicking on a playlist shows a list of videos. Clicking on a video plays the video.
        </text>
        <header>Changing channels</header>
        <text>Changing channels is simple. Click on the popup menu control on the left side of the
            action bar at the top of the screen.
        </text>
        <text>To navigate within the current channel. Show the slide out navigation drawer by
            clicking the top left icon in the action bar, or by swiping from the left side of the
            screen.
        </text>
        <text>The navigation drawer contains the About page, Playlists and Recent Uploads page.

        <text>When in portrait mode videos play in a custom video player. You can still scroll the
            video list while a video is playing. Turning the phone to landscape mode seemlessly
            continues playback without rebuffering.

    <page
        icon="editing"
        title="Editing the channels"
        >
        <text>The list of channels is only a default list to get you started. You can add or remove
            any channels you like.
        </text>
        <text>Open the overflow menu on the right of the action bar and choose 'Edit channels'. To
            remove a channel just hit the red minus button on any of the items. To add channels,
            choose the find button in the action bar and search for channels. Hit the plus
            button on the right of an item to add it.
        </text>
        <text>You can import your YouTube subscriptions if you already have a bunch of favorite
            channels in there. Import and add or remove any channels as needed. Don't worry,
            removing a channel here does not change your subscriptions on YouTube. This app simply
            imports
            the channel list from YouTube and doesn't edit your account in any way.
        </text>

    </page>

    <page
        icon="find"
        title="Find"
        >
        <text>There is a find button in the Action Bar. This searches the current list and will
            display any matches in the title or description for playlists and videos.
        </text>
        <text>The find feature only searches the current list and not every video or playlist
            contained in all lists or channels.
        </text>
        <text>Why doesn't it search everything within the app? That would require downloading
            everything all at once and the app only downloads data as lists are displayed. It's more
            of a filter for the current list rather than a global search. This makes it both fast
            and efficient.
        </text>
        <text>After viewing the find results, click the find button again to clear the current
            search and display the whole list.
        </text>

        title="Why is this better?"
        >
        <text>YouTube has an incredible selection of interesting videos. The problem is finding
            those videos and keeping track of channels you like.
        </text>
        <text>Sure there are subscriptions, but after subscribing to dozens of channels, now you
            have to navigate though a large subscription list every time you feel like watching a
            video.
        </text>
        <text>Launching apps is the simplest most straight forward UI on a mobile device. It's
            simple
            and does one clear task. Wouldn't it be nice if you were in the mood for tech news you
            could just click the tech news app?
        </text>
        <text>This is what this application attempts to do. Make watching videos a little bit
            simpler.
        </text>
        <text>And there are additional apps just like this you can download that cover additional
            topics.
